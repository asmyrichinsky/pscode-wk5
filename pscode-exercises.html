// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(number1 + number2= Total of both numbers)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

( If number (x) is divisible by /2, then print even
	
	else If number (x) is not divisible by 2 then print odd

// Exercise 3: Write Pseudo code that will perform the following.
	
	a) Read in 5 separate numbers.
	b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
	c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers. 
	d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are.

My Pseudocode	
	a) Read 5 numbers x(1-5). 

	b) Add the 5 numbers to give you the total. x(1) + x(2) + x(3) + x(4) + x(5)=Total

	c) Then divide the the total by the amount of numbers used to add the total. Total/5

	d) Label B) numbers x(1-5) as addends and Total as sum. 

	e) Label C) smallest addend as minimum. Label the largest as maximum
		If x(1)<=x(2) then take the one lesser and compare to <=x(3) then <=x(4) then <=x(5) then write minimum if addend is smallest 
		
		Then if x(1) >= x(2) then compare if >= to x(3) then >= x(4) then >= x(5). IF &&
